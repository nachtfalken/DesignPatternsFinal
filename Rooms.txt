3-Room3-The dark corridor continues. You think you see a blood splatter on the wall, but you're unsure from the lack of light. There are exits to the north and south.-4,0,2,0-0-0

5-Room5-You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points. It appears to be a dead end with the only exit where you came from to the east.-0,0,0,4-1-0
