1-Start-You are in the first room of the crypt, tattered banners of a long dead civilization adorn the walls. There are exits to the north, west, and east.-6,2,0,7-0-0
2-Room2-You are in a long and dark corridor with the only light from the flicker of your torches. There are exits to the dark unknown north and the entry room in the east.-3,0,0,1-0-0
3-Room3-The dark corridor continues. You think you see a blood splatter on the wall, but you're unsure from the lack of light. There are exits to the north and south.-4,0,2,0-0-0
4-Room4-It seems the masonry of the corridor suddenly ends in an old rusty door to the west built into a natural rock wall and a hallway to the south.-0,5,3,0-0-0
5-Room5-You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points. It appears to be a dead end.-0,0,0,4-1-0
6-Room6-A skeleton dressed in moth eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now open lock. Dust coats something sticky on the needles' points. There are exits to the south and east.-0,0,1,8-0-0
7-Room7-A cluster of low crates surrounds a barrel in the center of this chamber. Atop the barrel lies a stack of copper coins and two stacks of cards, one face up. Meanwhile, atop each crate rests a fan of five face down playing cards. A thin layer of dust covers everything. Clearly someone meant to return to their game of cards. There are exits to the north and west.-8,1,0,0-0-0
8-Room8-You smelled smoke as you moved down the hall, and rounding the corner into this room you see why. Every surface bears scorch marks and ash piles on the floor. The room reeks of fire and burnt flesh. Either a great battle happened here or the room bears some fire danger you cannot see for no flames light the room anymore. There are exits to the north, west, south, and east.-10,6,7,9-0-0
9-Room9-Three low, oblong piles of rubble lie near the center of this small room. Each has a weapon jutting upright from one end, a longsword, a spear, and a quarterstaff. The piles resemble cairns used to bury dead adventurers. There are exits to the north and south.-10,0,8,0-0-0
10-Room10-You enter the chamber to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests. It seems someone set them up to barricade the hall to the north. Three barrels are set up as seats near gaps in the barricade, no doubt the place where archers waited for foes. There are exits to the north, south, and east.-11,0,8,9-0-0
11-Room11-You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and victors stripped them of their valuables. There are exits to the north and east.-12,0,0,10-0-12
12-Room12-A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in stonework, but given the themes represented, it might be better described as a requiem. Scenes of death, both violent and peaceful, appear on every wall framed by grinning skeletons and ghoulish forms in ragged cloaks. There are exits to the west, south, and east.-0,14,11,13-0-0
13-Room13-Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears about 20 feet deep. A lattice of thick iron bars covers the top of each pit, and each lattice has a door of iron bars that can be lifted open. The pits smell of sweat and offal, but the room seems unoccupied. There are exits to the north and west.-15,12,0,0-0-0
14-Room14-This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state. In their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up by six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful woman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors is skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor must have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman. There are exits to the north and east.-16,0,0,12-0-0
15-Room15-This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15 foot wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn't allow you to see the full extent of them all. There are exits to the north and south.-17,0,13,0-0-0
16-Room16-This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone. There are exits to the north and south.-17,0,14,0-0-0
17-Room17-Unlike the flagstone common throughout the dungeon, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white. The ceiling is similarly marbled, but the thick pillars that hold it up are white. A brown stain drips down one side of a nearby pillar which you think may be blood. There are exits to the north, west, south, and east.-19,16,18,15-0-19
18-Room18-You open the door to reveal a 10 foot by 10 foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains.  No other doors are in the room, and it appears the door you opened was created to blend in with the walls. Additionally, you see no ceiling. You must be at the bottom of a very deep spiked pit. There is an exit to the north.-17,0,0,0-1-0
19-Room19-You enter a large chamber full of long tables and benches. It appears this once was some sort of dining hall, but many tables have been broken and everything is covered in dust. There are exits to the west, south, and east.-0,20,17,21-0-0
20-Room20-You get an uneasy feeling you can't shake when you enter this chamber. At the end of rows of pews is a 30 foot tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns merrily in a wide brazier the idol holds in its lap There are exits to the north and east.-23,0,0,19-0-0
21-Room21- There's a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.There are exits to the north and west.-22,19,0,0-0-0
22-Room22-The strong, sour sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone's wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish. There is an exit to the south.-0,0,21,0-1-0
23-Room23-Many small desks with high backed chairs stand in three long rows in this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted candle in a rusting tin candleholder. Everything is covered with dust. There is a large golden door to the east with two locks. There is a faint rumbling from the other side of it. There are other exits to the north and south.-24,0,20,25-0-25
24-Room24-A glow escapes this room through its open doorway. The masonry between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance. Glancing quickly about the room, you note that each stone bears the carving of someone's name. In the corner, you see your own name carved. There is an exit to the south.-0,0,23,0-0-0
25-BossRoom-Your are in the Boss room. There is an exit to the south.-0,0,23,0-0-0
